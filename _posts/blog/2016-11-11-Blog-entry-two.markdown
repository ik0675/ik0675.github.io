To be an active member of LAN, I have to create a capstone.
My capstone project is creating a personal website that introduces me, myself and I.
There is a brief chronological timeline of my college career.
I didn't fully implement this code yet, but I learned many technical skills including
new languages such as HTML, Javascript, and CSS while working on this project.
It required a great amount of time commitment. However, I actually earned in depth knowledge and it broadened technical views. Thus, I am proud of my progress until this point with my capstone project.
