Due to a project from CS 439, I started my capstone project lately. My capstone
project is creating a personal website that introduce me, myself and I.
There is a brief chronological timeline of my college career.
I didn't full implement this code, but I learned many technical skills including
new languages such as HTML, Javascript, and CSS while working this project.
It required some amount of a time commitment and it could seem for me to wast of
my time who is taking CS439. However, I actually earned much knowledge and broadened
technical views. Thus, I happily finished the capstone project.
