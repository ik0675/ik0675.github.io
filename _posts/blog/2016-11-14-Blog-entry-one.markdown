This semester, I made a big decision to join a fraternity, which was something
I have never thought I would do. Honestly, I never understood Greek life because it seemed
like it was a group of people paying money to make friends and party. However,
when I saw a flier in front of GDC that said “Rush Texas Lan 2016”, somehow,
I got interested. I thought it was a good idea to get to know people in Computer Science major
and expand my networking. Thus, I thought I would give it a try and went to the first meeting.
When I went, I felt a little intimidated because I had never been with that
many CS students in a one setting, but my intimidation and anxiety were soon eased.
I loved the atmosphere and people there. They were super friendly, easy to approach,
and welcoming, and I felt at home. The more meetings and events I attend, the more
I feel like I belong here. Though it took courage to get out of my comfort zone to try something
I had never done before, I am really glad I did because I love seeing and
interacting with so many different people and all the opportunities I have in this Fraternity. I can’t wait to be active!
