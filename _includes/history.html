        <p> I didn't get into Computer Science as I transferred to the University of Texas at Austin.
          Thus, I had to wait another year to be a member of UTCS. FOREVER UTCS!!!! </p>

        <h2>Europe Sensation</h2>
        <p> I was on a trip to explore Europe with my older brother. Traveling many countries,
          I broadened my view of the world. I faced many ethnicities, environments, people with
          various backgrounds. I really appreciated the change that I had to travel around
          and I really want to go back and feel it again. I went to Interlaken, Switzerland,
          italy, France, London, Great Britain, and Rome, Italy </p>

        <h2> Enjoyment -> hardship </h2>
        <p> During summer 2016, I was able to take upper division courses.
          The first course was CS429 with Prof. Ghieth(I didn't know until this time that
          Upper division courses are like lower division courses. I thought
          I could enjoy this course like cs 312 or CS314...And that was my dilusion). </p>
