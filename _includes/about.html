<div class="blurb"><p> Hi, my name is Ick Namgung and I am majoring in Computer Science
  at the University of Texas at Austin. Iâ€™m insanely passionate about teaching my knowledge of
  computer science as much as possible to those who are eager to learn.
  Also, I am interested to explore how the technology harmonizes with fashion.
  I want to have some real-life experience related to my major outside the classroom and
  discover the unique contributions I could make. I am attaching my resume and thank you
  in advance for your consideration.  </p></div>
